							When you use our Services, you are entering into a legal agreement and you agree to all of these terms.
							You also agree to our <a href = "privacy policy.php"> Privacy Policy</a>, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.
							You agree that by clicking “Join Now” “Join gradzgate”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services (including any content or information provided as part of these services, collectively, “Services”), you are entering into a legally binding agreement (even if you are using our Services on behalf of a company). If you reside in the Republic of the Philippines, your agreement is with gradzgate and if you reside outside of the Philippines, your agreement is with gradzgate international (each, “gradzgate” or “we”).

							This “Agreement” includes this User Agreement and the <a href="privacypolicy.php"> Privacy Policy</a>, and other terms that will be displayed to you at the time you first use certain features (such as starting a “Group,” downloading one of our software applications or purchasing advertisements or InMails™), as may be amended by gradzgate from time to time. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do NOT click “Join Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services.

							Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”. This Agreement applies to both.

					       &nbsp<b> 2.1. Service Eligibility</b> </br>
							Here are some promises you make to us in this Agreement:
							You're eligible to enter into this Agreement and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”
							To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the “Minimum Age” (defined below) or older; (2) you will only have one gradzgate account (and/or one SlideShare or Pulse account, if applicable), which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by gradzgate from using the Services.
							</br></br>
							“Minimum Age” means (a) 18 years old for the People's Republic of China, (b) 16 years old for the Netherlands, (c) 14 years old for the United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia and South Korea, and (d) 13 years old for all other countries. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for gradzgate to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage and use of your information) then the Minimum Age is such older age. The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 13.
												      
								</br></br>&nbsp <b>2.2. Your Membership</b></br>
							You'll keep your password a secret.
							You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.
							As between you and others, your account belongs to you. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections, groups) and (4) follow the law and the Dos and Don'ts below. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
							</br></br>
							Note that for Premium Services purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for the Premium Service controls such an account (which is different from your personal account) and may terminate your access to it.


							</br></br> &nbsp <b>2.3. Messages and Sharing</b></br>
							When you share information, others can see, copy and use that information.
							Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, slide deck, links to news articles, job postings, InMails and blogs. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members or, if public, by Visitors. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., sharing to a group instead of your network, changing the default setting for gradzgate content from public to a more restricted view, limiting your profile visibility, or not letting people know when you change your profile, make recommendations or follow companies). Note that other activities, such as applying for a job or sending an InMail, are by default private, only visible to the addressee(s).
							</br></br>
							We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.

These rights are limited in the following ways:
							</br></br>
							&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>a.</b> You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
							</br></br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>b.</b> We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of others (including sponsored content) to others without your separate consent. However, we have the right, without compensation to you or others, to serve ads near your content and information, and your comments on sponsored content may be visible as noted in the <a href ="privacypolicy.php"> Privacy Policy </a>.
							</br></br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>c.</b> We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your posts beyond the Service.

You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. gradzgate may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.


							</br></br>

							&nbsp <b>3.2. Service Availability</b></br>
							We may change or discontinue any of our Services. We can't promise to store or keep showing any information and content you've posted.
							We may change, suspend or end any Service, or change and modify prices prospectively in our discretion. To the extent allowed under law, these changes may be effective upon notice provided to you.

							&nbsp <b>3.3. Other Content, Sites and apps</b></br>
							When you see or use others' content and information posted on our Services, it's at your own risk.
							Third parties may offer their own products and services through gradzgate, and we aren't responsible for those third-party activities.
							By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. gradzgate generally does not review content provided by our Members.

							</br></br>
							You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third party apps or sites that link from our Services. If you allow a third party app or site to authenticate you or connect with your gradzgate account, that app or site can access information on gradzgate related to you and your connections. Third party apps and sites have their own legal terms and privacy policies, and you may be giving others permission to use your information in ways we would not.

Please see Sections 2.6 and 2.7 of the <a href="privacypolicy.php">Privacy Policy</a>.

							&nbsp <b>3.4. Limits</b></br>
							We have the right to limit how you connect and interact on our Services.
							We're providing you notice about our intellectual property rights.
							gradzgate reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. gradzgate reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if gradzgate believes that you may be in breach of this Agreement or law or are misusing the Services (e.g. violating any Do and Don'ts).
